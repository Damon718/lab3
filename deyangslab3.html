<h2><em>The Little Prince</em>, by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</h2>
<p>I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn’t much improved my opinion of them.</p>

<p>All men have stars, but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems... But all these stars are silent. You-You alone will have stars as no one else has them.</p>

<p>And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.</p>


<h2><em>Utopia</em>, by Thomas More</h2>
<p>For if you suffer your people to be ill-educated, and their manners to be corrupted from their infancy, and then punish them for those crimes to which their first education disposed them, what else is to be concluded from this, but that you first make thieves and then punish them.</p>
<p>Instead of inflicting these horrible punishments, it would be far more to the point to provide everyone with some means of livelihood, so that nobody's under the frightful necessity of becoming first a thief and then a corpse.</p>
<p>Kindness and good nature unite men more effectually and with greater strength than any agreements whatsoever, since thereby the engagements of men's hearts become stronger than the bond and obligation of words.</p>


<h2><em>Das Kapital</em>, by Karl Marx</h2>
<p>Every one knows that there are no real forests in England. The deer in the parks of the great are demurely domestic cattle, fat as London alderman.</p>
<p>Since the working-class lives from hand to mouth, it buys as long as it has the means to buy.</p>
<p>But capitalist production begets, with the inexorability of a law of Nature, its own negation. It is the negation of negation.</p>
